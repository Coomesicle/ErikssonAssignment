# ErikssonAssignment

To run:

```console
cd LoggingParser
dotnet run
```

### Process

For this assignment, I choose to make a CLI, I figured it would be the easiest way to make an application that's interactable. I created a log class with a Timestamp, Event_Type, and Message variable to organize the error lines, there is a function to parse through the log files and return a List of all the logs. I added a function to print the terminal message to display the options the user has and there is a function for each of the options within the terminal.

### Asssumptions

The biggest assumption I made was about finding the frequent messages, I removed all text after the colon in the messages, for example:

```
INFO User logged in: user107
ERROR File not found: backup.zip
WARNING Disk usage exceeded 95%
```

became

```
INFO User logged in
ERROR File not found
WARNING Disk usage exceeded 95%
```

This was to shorten the message and get more similar messages. There are definetly other algorithms to use depending on the application, if the user wants to search for an error or knows the type of errors they are getting, it can be tweaked to set how similar the message strings can be.

### Testing

There are two extra testing files, both generated by ChatGPT to test code in `examples/`
